# Foam Notes
Inspired by classmates who started using foam, I'm trying out foam to consolidate all my coursework and projects into one medium I can access! 
  
current coursework:
- MUS 407 Electronic Music Techniques I
- MUS 305 Computer Music Compositions (musx)

1. main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) 
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.

Helpful Links:
- [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.
- [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!
