# Foam Notes
Inspired by classmates who started using foam, I'm trying out foam to consolidate all my coursework and projects into one medium I can access! 
  
1. main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) 
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

Helpful Links:
- [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!
- [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.
- [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!

## Using Foam Templates
- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[getting-started]] - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.
