# Synthesis and Spectral Composition

* In sound synthesis complex waves are generated by algorithms of some type:

    * Ring Modulation
    * Frequency Modulation
    * Amplitude Modulation
    * Karplus Strong
    * Granular Synthesis
    * Physical Modeling

Spectral composers adapt these synthesis techniques to compute 'symbolic spectra' (pitch sets) rather than, or in addition to, audio signals.
