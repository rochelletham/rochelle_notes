# Synthesis and Spectral Composition

* In sound synthesis complex waves are generated by algorithms of some type:

    * Ring Modulation
    * Frequency Modulation
    * Amplitude Modulation
    * Karplus Strong
    * Granular Synthesis
    * Physical Modeling

Spectral composers adapt these synthesis techniques to compute 'symbolic spectra' (pitch sets) rather than, or in addition to, audio signals.

## Ring Modulation

## Frequency Modulation
* the frequency of a carrier wave is altered by a modulator signal:
    * The *carrier to modulator ratio (C:M)* determines the harmonicity of the resulting spectrum.
    * For harmonic spectra, M must have an integer relationship to C
    * Non-integer ratios produce _inharmonic spectra_

* FM needs three parameters:
    * *index (I)*: number of sidebands (density, or width, of the spectrum)
    * carrier (center frequency)
    * c/m ratio (carrier/modulator ratio)
musx function: fmspectrum(carrier, ratio, index)
