##### Some context:  
Mechanical: like record player 1977-1925  
Electro-mechanical: 1925-1945  
Magnetic: 1945-1975  
Digital: computers! 1975-current  
Mechanical Recording  
-strictly physical/mechanical process  
-no microphones, no means of electrical amplification  
     -sound wave vibrations transfer directly to stylus/lathe  
     -stylus/lathe engraves impressionable medium  
  
  
### Phonoautograph  
-traced sound vibrations that were etched onto paper/glass.  
-one way process, can’t go back.  
-intended as laboratory instrument for studying acoustics  
#### Phonograph (tinfoil)    
Thomas Edison    
-first device capable of sound recording/playback  
-sound-vibrated stylus cuts into impressionable medium  
    -initial concept: tinfoil sheet wrapped around crank-turned cylindrical drum  
    -hand turns the crank  
    -pressure variations translate as vertical cuts  
    -ex: quieter sound makes shallow cut, stylus moves forward and back  
-low level and low quality reproduction, impression degraded beyond recognition after few reproductions  
  
[insert image here ]  
-new improvements, used hollow wax cylinders than tin foil  
-added acoustic horn for greater sound transmission efficiency  
-stylus moves laterally instead of cylinder  
-beginnings of commercial success  
-works just barely

### Gramophone  
Different mechanism to avoid patent infringement  
Lateral-cut wax disc  
Taking wax cylinder and chopping into pepperoni slices. Each slice sits on top of platter. Recorder takes slice and makes cuts around until the middle.   
Pressure variations originally depth base (compared to old lateral variation in phonograph)  
Inverted disc as master copy for mass reproduction  
Make a negative copy from original copy. Where there are grooves, there are peaks.  
Can then use inverted disc to be pressed into a wax cylinder to make copies  

### Gramophone vs Phonograph  
-First “media format war”  
-lateral disc commercially overtook cylinder in 1920  
More convenient to store  
Fit nicely on shelf, uses discs  
Slightly cheaper to manufacture  
Slightly louder in sound reproduction  
Can make inverted copies  
Mechanical improvements: stable spring-wound motors  
Turn record needle by itself, dont need to crank  
Gently turn the needle from outer to inner part of disc  
Beginnings of music industry  
Gramophone companies  
Victrola  
Series of commercial gramophones  


### Electro-Mechanical Recording
Hybrid process  
Improving accuracy of recording practice  
Rise of condenser microphones -- much more sensitive, capture wider range of frequencies, can record softer sounds  
Tech advances: enable amplification and filtering of sound via electronic means  
Disc-cutting: electrically driven mechanical process  
Significant improvements in dynamic range and frequency response  
Integrated electrical recording system, introduced by Western Electric  
Supply/research branch of AT&T  
Cofounded Bell Telephone Laboratories  
Trained engineers with goal of making recording process as faithful, efficient as possible  
Rise of audio engineering   
New consumer devices designed for electrically-made recordings  
Ex: Victor Orthophonic Victrola  


### Magnetic Recording -- World War II
**Operating principle**:  
Magnetic medium passes across electromagnet at a constant speed  
AC audio signal creates a pattern of magnetization on medium  
Magnetized medium passes across another electromagnet at constant speed, inducing AC in wire conductor  

### Telegraphone (Valdemar Poulsen, Danish engineer, 1898  
Steel wire recording medium
Magnetic material (steel)  
Adapted from ideas in “Some Possible Forms of the Phonograph” Oberlin Smith (American engineer)  

**Limitations**  
Poor signal level and fidelity  
Some household/office use, no widespread commercial success  
Curt Stille: 1924 wire recorder with signal amplification improvements  
-wire often became tangled, splicing involved knotting ends together  
-licensed by Ludwig Blattner  
Blattnerphone: late 1920s, replacing steel wire with steel tape  
One spool: 21 lbs  
-Notably used by British Broadcast company  


### Magnetophon  
-AEG (German electric company)  
Plastic tape coated in iron particles  
Simplified audio editing via cutting and splicing  
Significant use in radio broadcast and concert recording  
Technology kept secret until end of WWII  
Negative component  
People can easily edit recordings  
Widespread availability and development post-WWII  
    
-development by Ampex, Rangertone, 3M  
Gradual improvements in tape speed, duration, and frequency response  
Like how to move tape slower and still keep quality of the audio  
only so much info can be encoded. Magnetic components can only take in so much, so high frequencies aren’t captured entirely  
Result: 1947: 3M develops a red oxide-coated plastic tape, 7.5 inches/sec, frequency response up to 15 kHz
Tape decks become smaller, more portable, oriented toward consumer high-fidelity/home entertainment  
Aided by improved use interfaces, transistors replacing vacuum tubes  


### Technics RS-1500 reel-to-reel tape recorder (ca 1976-1985)  
  
Compact Cassette Tape  
Sony/Phillips  
-culmination of consumer-level magnetic recording  
-tape encased in hard plastic instead of open reels  
-ease of recording

### Multi-Track Magnetic Recording  
Magnetic tape developed to accommodate for multiple simultaneous audio signals  
-physical tape width split into recordable divisions  
→ increased engineering possibilities: record 4 tracks at the same time, sum monophonic tracks through   mixer and record to single track on second tape deck  
-->record 4 different tones, route the outputs to 1 track using mixer    
  
### Digital Recording
**Operating principle:**  
Sound captured via rapid, periodic series of discrete measurements of an electrical signal level, called samples (analog to digital conversion)  
Samples stored as binary data, usually on computer  
Waveform reconstructed from discrete data (digital to analog conversion)  
CD compact disc -- half diameter of polyvinyl discs, nearly twice in duration  
Optical disc reading process, far slower physical degradation process  
.96 dB dynamic range, full representation of audible spectrum  
  
  
### Digital Audio Tape (DAT)
Hybrid format in which binary data is magnetically recorded on tape  
Physical media largely eclipsed by digital audio file formats and internet-based distribution models, CD sales declining through the 2000s  
  
### MP3 format, 1993  
Developed by Motion Picture Experts Group, AIFF, WAV, AAC don’t reduce/compress the data  
Best sound factors:  
-hardware using, where you are listening to the audio  
Recording Technology continually influenced by:  
1. expansion of internet-based tools  
2. proliferation/standardization of personal computers  
3. audio software for mobile platforms  
4. Improvements in processor speed and hard drive storage    
    -products are more available, affordable for home recording equipment
