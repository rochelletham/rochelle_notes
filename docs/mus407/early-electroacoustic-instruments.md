# Early Electroacoustic Instruments
## __Experiments and Accidents__
### Musical Telegraph (1874) Elisha Gray    
-polyphonic, one octave, later two  
-metal reeds vibrate via self-oscillating currents, transmitted via telephone wire  
-washbasin as receiver/amplifier  

### Singing Arc (1899) William Duddell, british physicist    
-attempting to remove buzzing noise from carbon arc street lamps  
-added LC resonant circuit, arc frequency turnable by varying input voltage  
-tune the circuit buzzing  
-later added piano keyboard for voltage control      

### Telharmonium (1897-1914) Thaddeus Cahill American inventor/lawyer
-first true electronic music synthesizer  
-six octave polyphony, touch sensitive, some timbre control  
#### Timeline  
1897: patent acquired  
1900: Washington DC: first prototype/demonstration  
1902: lab established in MA. NY?New England Electric Music Company established  
1904: Cahill Telharmonium Co. established  
1906: ”Telharmonic Hall” on 39th and Broadway, NYC. Many public concerts/transmissions  
1907: complications, telephone wave interference  
1908: public transmissions slow  
1910: sponsor support wanes, Telharmonic Hall closes  
1911-12: third Telharmonium constructed with several improvements, final debut stream to Carnegie Hall  
1914: Cahill Telharmonium Co. declares bankruptcy  
Telharmonium specifications  
-only three constructed  
-60 ft mainframe, 10 switchboard panels, 2000 switches, 145 rheotomes (“tone wheels” acting as alternators) -- tone wheels turn to periodically opening and closing circuits.  
-approx 5 mil o___o  
Telharmonium operating principles  
-12 rotating shafts, one for each chromatic pitch  
-several cogged “tonewheels” -- different spacing and size to create fundamental and necessary overtones to create specific timbre  
-each shaft driven by one belt, preventing tuning drift (stays in tune :O)  


#### Telharmonium decline    
-expensive!!  $1M spent, not inflation-adjusted  
-rapidly obsoleted by technological advancements  
Rapidly obsoleted by technological advancements:   
    -wireless radio transmissions  
    -vacuum

#### Vacuum Tube
-invention in 1920’s and subsequent widespread availability  
-allowed control and amplification of current without moving parts  
-applications in tv  


### Theremin
-invented by **Leon Theremin**
-US tour, patented 1927-28  
-unique ability to be played without touch, highly accessible, no piano keyboard  
-later Moog started building theremins in 1950’s  
-commercially available, still pretty popular  
**HOW IT WORKS**  
-2 antennae control → amplitude and frequency  
-uses Heterodyne Principle  
2 RF oscillators: one variable, one fixed at ~300 kHz  
Antenna and grounded performer act as capacitor (compare to a condenser microphone. Your body is grounded and your hand act as the capacitor like in a microphone)  
-2 oscillators are multiplied together, producing 2 tones at sum/difference frequencies (called heterodynes)    
    
**Ring modulation/Heterodyne**
-multiplying two different sine waves  
    
Listening examples:   
-Good Vibrations  
-Clara Rockmore: The Swan    
  
  
  
### Ondes Martenot
Pronounced “ohn”  
By Maurice Martenot (French inventor)  
-intended as a lasting instrument, with hope to be taken seriously by musicians  
-monophonic heterodyning instrument  
-pitch control via ring on ribbon; lateral movement creates glissando  
-later versions included “organ” stops and proper keyboard (appeal for familiar interface)  
-compared to theremin, ondes martenot you touch the keys, and button for immediate/varying attack tone speed, timbre controls  
  
### Trautonium 1930 by Friedrich Trautwein, Germain engineer
-monophonic keyboard-like instrument, w/out familiar keyboard interface  
-wire suspended over metal rail  
-has sawtooth-like waveform routed through resonant filters (early form of subtractive synthesis)  
-has wide variety of timbres, sometimes sounds like a trumpet/saxophone/woodwind instrument  
  
Examples: Paul Hindemith: Concerto for Trautonium (1930)   
Oskar Sala created Mixtur-Trautonium (1936). Made to sound like birds  
-sounds like screams mixed in with bird screech  
-featured on Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds  
Hammond Organ by Laurens Hammond  
-intended as household organ substitute, not to create novel new sounds  
-similar to Telharmonium. Has tonewheels + vacuum tube amplifiers  
-commercially successful, invented the Novachord  
-has distinctive set of timbral controls  
  
  
### RCA Mark II Synthesizer  
  
-floor to ceiling synthesizer, numerous signal processing modules  
-controlled by binary data, from punched holes on paper  
-instruments like piano: limited by human physicality (ex: can’t trill faster than a certain limit)  
-RCA Mark II Synthesizer not limited by human physicality, theoretically complete control over all musical parameters  
-combination of complex sound generation and sequencing  
-acquired by Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center  
-used prominently by Milton Babbitt  
Harmonic Tone Generator  
-James Beauchamp  
-one of the first additive voltage-controlled synthesizers  
-features:  
     -precise generation of first six harmonics of a fundamental  

  
    
  
  
### Pop quizzzzzz
Why did the Telharmonium fall into decline, instead of seeing widespread commercial success?  
The rise of AT&T and telephone becoming more popular interfered with the waves from Telharmonium  
Expensive  
Behind new technology vacuum tube  
  
  
not limited by human physicality
Oskar Sala continued developing Trautonium, eventually resulting in what instrument, notably featured on Alfred Hitchcock’s film, The Birds?  
 Mixtur-Trautonium  
What was Lauren Hammon’s primary goal with developing the Hammond Organ?  
intended as household organ substitute, not to create novel new sounds  
similar to Telharmonium. Has tonewheels + vacuum tube amplifiers  
commercially successful, invented the Novachord
